    This challenge is to build out this interactive comments section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.<br>
  
    Users should be able to:

    <ul>
      <li>
        View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
      </li> <li>
        See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
      </li> <li>
        Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
      </li> <li>
        Upvote and downvote comments
      </li> <li>
        Bonus: If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
      </li> 
    </ul>
